# Library Management System

## Project Summary

The **Library Management System** is designed to streamline the management of library resources, book loans, and user activities. The system provides functionalities for both users (members) and administrators (librarians and admins) to facilitate the borrowing, returning, and management of books. It also includes features for managing user accounts, book catalogs, borrowing limits, overdue fines, notifications, and reporting.

This system helps libraries operate more efficiently, ensuring users have easy access to library resources while also providing administrators with tools for managing inventory, user activity, and reports.

## Features

- **User Management**: Registration, login/logout, password recovery, email verification, and role-based access control for members and administrators.
- **Book Catalog Management**: Adding, updating, deleting, and categorizing books. Allows easy searching and filtering of books.
- **Book Borrowing and Return System**: Borrow books, track borrowing history, set borrowing limits, manage overdue fines, and renew books.
- **Search Functionality**: Advanced search by title, author, genre, and more.
- **Inventory and Stock Management**: Monitor book availability, track borrowed and returned books, and manage damaged or lost books.
- **Notifications**: Send email/SMS notifications for overdue books, return reminders, and reserved book availability.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Generate detailed reports on library usage, inventory, borrowing trends, and user activity.
- **Security and Data Protection**: Role-based access control, data encryption, secure login, and two-factor authentication (2FA).
